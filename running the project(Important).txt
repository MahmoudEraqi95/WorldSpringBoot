1- well, you'll need to pull the database image .
2-build an image for th spring boot by running the following command in the directory of the project
	-docker build -t flairstech-task-final .
3-run the following command in the directory of the project
	-docker-compose up

PS- Iam usin Docker Toolbox, not Docker Desktop as it requires windows 10 Pro, which i don't have , 
using docker toolbox doesn't allow you to run you container in localhost, instead it gives you a default ip 
which is 192.168.99.100, so in case you've a trouble connecting from localhost, in you Docker Desktop, 
maybe you can try this ip.

you can check this url: https://forums.docker.com/t/how-to-use-localhost-instead-of-192-168-99-100/54098

and you're good to go.
Thanks
